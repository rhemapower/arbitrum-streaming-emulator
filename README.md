# PathPulse Goal Tracker

A blockchain-based personal goal tracking system built on Stacks, enabling users to create, manage, and verify progress on their personal goals with optional staking and third-party verification.

## Overview

PathPulse leverages blockchain technology to provide a transparent and immutable goal tracking platform. Users can:

- Create personal goals with specific metrics and deadlines
- Break down goals into verifiable milestones
- Stake tokens to increase commitment
- Assign "witnesses" for third-party verification
- Track progress in a transparent way
- Choose between public and private goal visibility

## Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User] -->|Creates| B[Goal]
    B -->|Contains| C[Milestones]
    B -->|Optional| D[Stake]
    B -->|Optional| E[Witness]
    E -->|Verifies| C
    C -->|Completion| F[Goal Completion]
    F -->|Triggers| G[Stake Release]
```

The system is built around two main data structures:
- Goals: Track high-level goal information and metadata
- Milestones: Track individual steps toward goal completion

## Contract Documentation

### Core Components

#### Goals Map
Stores goal information including:
- Title and description
- Deadline
- Privacy settings
- Witness address
- Stake amount
- Milestone completion tracking

#### Milestones Map
Tracks individual milestones with:
- Title and description
- Completion status
- Verification details
- Completion timestamp

```

## Key Components

### Token Stream Structure
- Stream ID
- Sender
- Recipient
- Token Contract
- Total Stream Amount
- Start Time
- End Time
- Claimed Amount
- Stream Status

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Clarinet
- Stacks wallet
- Token contract

### Basic Usage

1. Create a token stream:
```clarity
(contract-call? .stream-emulator create-stream 
    'recipient-address 
    'token-contract-address
    u1000 ;; Total amount
    u100 ;; Start block
    u200  ;; End block
)
```

2. Claim stream tokens:
```clarity
(contract-call? .stream-emulator claim-stream-tokens u1)
```

## Function Reference

### Stream Management

```clarity
(create-stream 
  (recipient principal)
  (token-contract principal)
  (total-amount uint)
  (start-time uint)
  (end-time uint))

(claim-stream-tokens (stream-id uint))
```

### Read-Only Functions

```clarity
(get-stream-details 
  (stream-id uint) 
  (sender principal))

(get-claimable-amount 
  (stream-id uint) 
  (sender principal))
```

## Development

### Testing
1. Install Clarinet
2. Run tests:
```bash
clarinet test
```

### Local Development
1. Start Clarinet console:
```bash

```

2. Deploy contract:
```bash
clarinet deploy
```

## Security Considerations

### Design Principles
- Block height-based time tracking
- Proportional token distribution
- Immutable stream creation
- No partial stream modification

### Best Practices
- Validate token contracts before streaming
- Consider gas costs and block time
- Review stream parameters carefully
- Test with small amounts first# Arbitrum Streaming Emulator

- Sender
- Recipient
- Token Contract
- Total Stream Amount
- Start Time
- End Time
- Claimed Amount
- Stream Status

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Clarinet
- Stacks wallet
- Token contract

### Basic Usage

1. Create a token stream:
```clarity
(contract-call? .stream-emulator create-stream 
    'recipient-address 
    'token-contract-address
    u1000 ;; Total amount
    u100 ;; Start block
    u200  ;; End block
)
```

2. Claim stream tokens:
```clarity
(contract-call? .stream-emulator claim-stream-tokens u1)
```

## Function Reference

### Stream Management

```clarity
(create-stream 
  (recipient principal)
  (token-contract principal)
  (total-amount uint)
  (start-time uint)
  (end-time uint))

(claim-stream-tokens (stream-id uint))
```

### Read-Only Functions

```clarity
(get-stream-details 
  (stream-id uint) 
  (sender principal))

(get-claimable-amount 
  (stream-id uint) 
  (sender principal))
```

## Development

### Testing
1. Install Clarinet
2. Run tests:
```bash
clarinet test
```

### Local Development
1. Start Clarinet console:
```bash
clarinet console
```

2. Deploy contract:
```bash
clarinet deploy
```

## Security Considerations

### Design Principles
- Block height-based time tracking
- Proportional token distribution
- Immutable stream creation
- No partial stream modification

### Best Practices
- Validate token contracts before streaming
- Consider gas costs and block time
- Review stream parameters carefully
- Test with small amounts first# Arbitrum Streaming Emulator

A decentralized smart contract for simulating token streaming and time-based value distribution on Stacks blockchain, with flexible allocation and verification mechanisms.

## Overview

The Arbitrum Streaming Emulator provides a robust, flexible mechanism for creating and managing token streams, enabling precise, time-based token distribution with granular control.

## Features

- Create customizable token streams
- Time-proportional token allocation
- Flexible start and end times
- Claimable token distribution
- Stream status tracking
- Minimal overhead and gas consumption

## Security Considerations

### Design Principles
- Block height-based time tracking
- Proportional token distribution
- Immutable stream creation
- No partial stream modification

### Best Practices
- Validate token contracts before streaming
- Consider gas costs and block time
- Review stream parameters carefully
- Test with small amounts first
   - Optional third-party verification
   - Witnesses must verify milestone completion

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Clarinet
- Stacks wallet
- STX tokens (for staking)

### Basic Usage

1. Create a new goal:
```clarity
(contract-call? .pathpulse create-goal 
    "Learn Clarity" 
    "Master Clarity smart contract development" 
    (some u144000) ;; Deadline
    u1 ;; Public
    none ;; No witness
    u100) ;; Stake 100 STX
```

2. Add a milestone:
```clarity
(contract-call? .pathpulse add-milestone 
    u1 
    "Complete basic tutorial" 
    "Finish the Clarity basics tutorial")
```

3. Complete a milestone:
```clarity
(contract-call? .pathpulse complete-milestone u1 u1)
```

## Function Reference

### Goal Management

```clarity
(create-goal (title (string-ascii 100)) 
            (description (string-utf8 500))
            (deadline (optional uint))
            (privacy uint)
            (witness (optional principal))
            (stake-amount uint))

(add-milestone (goal-id uint)
              (title (string-ascii 100))
              (description (string-utf8 500)))

(complete-milestone (goal-id uint) (milestone-id uint))

(verify-milestone (user principal) (goal-id uint) (milestone-id uint))
```

### Goal Administration

```clarity
(update-goal-privacy (goal-id uint) (privacy uint))
(update-goal-witness (goal-id uint) (witness (optional principal)))
(claim-stake (goal-id uint))
```

## Development

### Testing
1. Install Clarinet
2. Run tests:
```bash
clarinet test
```

### Local Development
1. Start Clarinet console:
```bash
clarinet console
```

2. Deploy contract:
```bash
clarinet deploy
```

## Security Considerations

### Known Limitations
- Goal deadlines are based on block height
- Witnesses cannot be changed after milestone verification begins
- No partial stake withdrawal

### Best Practices
- Always verify goal privacy settings before sharing sensitive information
- Use witnesses for important goals requiring verification
- Set realistic deadlines (in block height)
- Consider token stake amounts carefully
- Review goal and milestone details before creation as they cannot be modified
